			    <h4>Test Description</h4>
				<p>This test provides capability for implementers and providers to conduct one or more successful electronic exchange tests with a 
					registered health IT developer’s Test EHR.  The testing process will approximate a “real-life” environment as much as possible.  
					Electronic exchange will be accomplished by utilizing the required transport standard §170.202(a) Direct Messaging. </p>
					
			    <p>The Provider supplies the test data for this test.</p>
			    
			    <h4>Provider Test Instruction </h4>
			    <p>This Provider test instruction is organized into six sections:</p>
			    <ul style="margin-left: 0px;">
			       <li><u>Schedule and Set Up Test with Registered Developer</u> – Provider utilizes information from  “SITE” to schedule a testing time 
			       	   with Registered Developer, and supplies the Provider’s EHR Trust Anchor and Digital Certificate (communications conducted directly between 
			       	   the Provider and Developer, not through  “SITE”)</li>
			       <li><u>Receive Test EHR Information</u> – Provider downloads the following Test EHR information from “SITE”
			          <ul style="margin-left: 0px;">
			          	<li>Direct Address</li>
			          	<li>Trust Anchor</li>
			          	<li>Digital certificate associated with the Direct address</li>
			          </ul>
			       </li>
			       
			       <li><u>Install Test EHR Trust Anchor and Digital Certificate</u> – Provider utilizes information from “SITE” to install the Test EHR’s 
			       	   Trust Anchor and Digital Certificate</li>
				   <li><u>Create Summary Care Record</u> – Using test data only (that is, no real, live patient data), Provider creates a Consolidated CDA conformant 
				   	   summary care record </li>
				   <li><u>Transmit Direct Message</u> – Provider sends a Direct Message with the Consolidated CDA conformant summary care record to Test EHR</li>
				   
				   <li><u>Receive Email Notification</u> – Provider waits to receive an email notification from the Registered Developer indicating 
				   		if a message was successfully received by the Test EHR or if the test was a failure within one day of the completion of the test.</li>
			    </ul>
